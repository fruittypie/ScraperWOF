# Casino Results Scraper and Analyzer

This project aims to scrape casino game results from a website, store them in a database, and then analyze the data to calculate statistics on winning number occurrence and gaps between numbers. It utilizes various technologies such as web scraping, database management, algorithmic analysis, websockets, and front-end development to provide a dynamic and interactive interface for users to explore the collected data.

## Features

- **Web Scraping:** Automated scraping of casino game results from a specified website.
- **Data Storage:** Results are stored in a database for easy retrieval and analysis.
- **Error Handling:** Methods implemented to double-check game results and correct any scraping mistakes.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Algorithms calculate statistics on winning number occurrence and gaps between numbers.
- **Dynamic Visualization:** Websockets used to dynamically display scraped and analyzed data in real-time.
- **Frontend Interface:** Utilizes React, Bootstrap, and custom settings to provide an interface for viewing statistics on each number and refining analysis parameters.
- **Deployment:** Deployed on an AWS EC2 instance with static files stored on an S3 bucket, using Nginx for web server configuration.

## Future Development

- **Enhanced Analysis:** Incorporating more advanced algorithms for deeper insights.
- **Improved User Experience:** Adding additional features for a richer user experience.
- **Scalability:** Optimizing the architecture for handling larger datasets.
- **Testing Framework:** Implementing a robust testing framework to ensure reliability and stability.
